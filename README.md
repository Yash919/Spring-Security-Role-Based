# Spring-Security

## Overview
This Spring Security project demonstrates how to implement role-based access control and user authentication using Spring Security in a Spring Boot application. It includes features like user registration, product management, and access control based on user roles.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in to the system securely.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different users have different roles (e.g., ADMIN, USER) and access levels based on their roles.
- **Product Management**: CRUD operations for managing products, with certain operations restricted to specific user roles.
- **RESTful API**: Exposes RESTful endpoints for various operations like product management and user registration.
- **Password Encryption**: Passwords are securely encrypted using BCryptPasswordEncoder before storing in the database.
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection is enabled to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive operations.

## Dependencies
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- Spring Data JPA
- SQL Database (MySQL Workbench or any other you preferred)

## Database
### UserInfo:
- Entity [**UserInfo.java**] class representing user information.
- Stores user details including username, password and roles.
